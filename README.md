# Code summary

  * This program asks the user for 3 numbers through prompts and stores them in variables. It then analyzes the numbers to identify the largest, middle, and smallest values. The program prints the numbers in both descending (from largest to smallest) and ascending (from smallest to largest) order. If all three numbers are equal, it displays a message stating that all the numbers are the same.

## Explanation:

  Although there are simpler ways to sort numbers using built-in methods such as sort(), the goal of this program is to manually evaluate how the logic behind such sorting functions works. By implementing the logic ourselves, we gain a deeper understanding of comparison, conditional structures, and the process of sorting elements without relying on abstract methods. This approach helps strengthen the basic building blocks of algorithm development.
